# Portfolio Back-End by Matthijn

## Introduction

As you've already known that I made my own website with GitHub static hosting. To take my web-developing skill to the next level, I would like to enhance my site with back-end web-development.

There are several instruments that I'd like to enhance it with back-end:
1. **Blogs**: I'm going to store my blogs in a database (using MongoDB).
2. **Galleries**: I'm going to store my photos in a cloud storage to prevent my assets to be stolen.
3. **Contact**: I'm going to use my own script to handle form instead of using Formspree's API.

**Finally, I would like you to check my portfolio by checking on this site!: https://maatthijn.github.io/**

## What's New?

### v1.1
1. Added Vercel deployment to the site.
2. Fixed every problem with my blog fetching mechanism.
3. Added a script to fetch galleries from database (which stores URLs from Cloudinary).

## Logs

### v1.0
1. Added a script to fetch blogs from database.
